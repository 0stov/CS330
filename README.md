You will also reflect on the work that you have done in this project. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will also help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below, using the sub-bullets to help guide your thoughts. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

How do I approach designing software?
I apprroach software design by first laying out what is required by the software I will create. I spend as much time on this part as I can afford as I believe its the most important. Createing tests that my code can perform the required tasks is second priority. After that, all it takes is to implement the requirements. If I spent enough time on design, I will already know how things will work and how each part will itneract.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This class has taught me a lot about how to analyze someone elses code and interperet how to read documentation. I spent a lot of time analyzing the example code in unit 1 and looking at openGL docs/example code to try and figure out why the hell my code wouldn't do what I want. Given enough time I was able to reverse engineer almost everything I wanted. The only unresolvable issues I had were with visual studio itself (I think that was the issue).

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I tried to follow my usual process mentioned in a previous question but that process broke down a bit when I realized openGL didn't work the way I thought halfway throught the units. I would understand the reading and the math (I thought) and would go to implement the math in code and I would hit errors. Most of these errors were due to forgetting to declare something earlier in the code or switching the function on.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I learned a lot about planning for learning something from scratch. I walked into this class very ignorment about visualization and it was difficult to come up with a design strategy for each unit when I had never played with that aspect of openGL before. Its important to leave 'wiggle' room in design. Or, a plan B in case the first plan turns out to be too much work or litterally impossible.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Adapting or pivoting creatively. I had several times where my original plan just wouldn't work. Instead of stubbornly trying to figure out why my texture wouldn't apply correctly, I realized it would be easier to change the plan a tad and apply a different texture, or adopt a texture I knew would work. For example, I had several "Cardback" textures that I could NOT get to work. I decided to just pick a different cardback with a different resolution a few times until I found one that works. I figured if theres time at the end of the week I could double back to figure out what had happened.

How did iteration factor into your development?
For the final project I tried to just get a working image up and running, then going back to refine it. I didn't know how long it would take to finish so I slapped something sloppy together and when I saw I had a good amount of time left I went back and 'polished' my design. Added better comments, tweaked the numbers to get the shininess of the cards to look better, tweaked the colors of the chips to match metter, and picking a better textures for some object are some examples.


How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Looking back at my earlier milestones, theres a clear progression. Each stages I learned to iterate and build up the complex object into something that looked better and better. By the end I definately feel liked I learned how to refine an object visually.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science can help me reach my goals easily because computer science is my goal. I'l really like to end up in software development somewhere and studying computer science is both the means and the end to that goal.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations study showed me how much computation goes into every frame of a computer monitor. Theres so many matrix multiplicaitons that need to happen in an instant so its no wonder why we have a seperate, specialized, gpu for something like that. These exercized also help build an understanding of how to wrap my head around manipulating objects in a 3d space. I think this will help me with abstract thinking i.e. how to manipulate 3d object in a 3d space and how they interact.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Similarly to furthering my educational pathway, studying computational graphics will give me analysis skills that will also carry over to the workplace. It would also directly help me if I were to get a job in the computational graphics field.
